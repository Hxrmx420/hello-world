### 👋 **Hi there! I'm Emiliano Rozas** 🚀

I'm a **Junior Full-Stack Developer** with a strong background in **team leadership**, **customer care**, and **account management**. After years of optimizing processes and leading teams in dynamic B2B environments, I decided to take on a new challenge: **web development**.

Combining my leadership experience with my technical skills, I'm focused on building efficient, user-centric web applications. I recently completed an intensive **bootcamp at ISDI Coders**, where I honed my skills in **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB**.
